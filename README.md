MobiView can load and work with any Mobius model that has been compiled to a .dll using the Mobius dll interface. It understands the .dat format for parameters and inputs.

MobiView is made using the [Ultimate++](https://www.ultimatepp.org/) GUI library.

Known issues:
On some Windows 10 machines with small screens (i.e. laptops), the window scales in a way that makes the plot almost disappear.
